# CAKE.C
Originally written by (Charles Petzold in 2005 for a keynote at DevConnections)[http://www.charlespetzold.com/etc/Windows1/index.html],
CAKE.C is a Windows 1.0 application that displays an animated birthday cake, with a configurable number of candles.

This version has been slightly modified to:
 - Compile on Windows 10 in VS2019
 - Allow toggling the candles back off
 - Display a consistently black background
